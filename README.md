Hello,

This is a challenge from Frontend Mentor which consists of creating this simple DashBoard UI using HTML+CSS and some JS for the Dark/Light button toggler.

It is pretty simple to understand
- The index.html contains all the HTML.
- Style.css contains all the styling.
- Switch.js contains the logic for the dark/light button.

I also added some localStorage that allows the users to keep the theme they previously selected even if they reload their browser which is really interesting.

This project also allows you to understand the importance of CSS variables.
